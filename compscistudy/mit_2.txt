------ The well ordering Principle ------
2.1 Well Ordering Proofs
    idea: Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a smallest element.
    method: To prove that "P(n) is true for all integers of N."
        1. Define the set, C, of counterexamples that C is nonempty.
        2. Assume for proof by contradiction that C is nonempty.
        3. By the Well Ordering Principle, there will be a smallest element, n in C.
        4. Reach a contradiction -often by showing how to use n to find another
        member of C that is smaller than n.
        5. Conclude that C must be empty, that is , no counterexamples exist. QED.
