The Game is played by two players who on each turn 
subtract 1, 2, or 3 pieces from a shared pile of 15,
and they add that amount to their starting pile of 0.
They do this until the pile reaches 0. At that point
the winner is deemed by whoever has the EVEN
number of pieces in their individual pile.
